0	apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
1	nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .
0	i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .
0	also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything .
1	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
0	it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well .
1	some more manual control would have been nice .
0	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
0	this thing seriously is a good player though .
1	i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills .
0	the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .
0	and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .
0	the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .
1	the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
1	my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .
0	it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .
1	not plug & play ; . relies on id3 ; . no fm or recording
0	by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .
0	3660 had similar features , but that is big in size .
1	the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .
0	no matter the format .
0	overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .
0	this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .
1	when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .
1	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! .
0	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
1	and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .
1	- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
0	takes excellent photos .
1	like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .
0	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
0	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
1	this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .
0	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
1	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
0	2 ) storage capacity
0	it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .
1	*
0	i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .
0	some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $ 40 to buy vs .
0	i never had a single problem .
1	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
0	i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .
0	the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .
0	so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .
1	also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston .
0	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
0	overall i like it .
0	i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .
1	the only disappointment so far has been battery life .
0	another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .
0	as for bluetooth , no problems at all .
0	i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .
0	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
0	i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .
1	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last .
0	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
0	it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .
1	also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls .
0	and it is very easy to clean .
1	i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .
0	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
1	fm receiver - it has none .
0	firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .
0	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
0	the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .
1	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
0	which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .
0	it is small .
1	i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .
1	i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp .
0	i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .
1	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
0	i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .
0	friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .
1	i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .
0	the great and versatile ipod
0	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things .
1	the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that `` creates `` folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
1	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
0	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
0	all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .
0	i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .
0	when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .
1	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
1	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
1	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
1	i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .
1	i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .
1	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
1	when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! .
0	and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .
1	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
0	the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .
0	nice little phone . . . light compact . .
0	both the on/off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand .
1	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
0	the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .
0	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
0	i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .
0	im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
0	speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .
0	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
0	4- looks great .
0	value : comparing data storage with price .
0	this is also the case with nis 2004 .
1	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
1	our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .
0	i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .
0	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
0	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
1	it did also seem to have a strong `` new electronics `` smell for some time .
0	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .
0	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
0	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
0	i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .
0	it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .
1	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
1	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing .
1	i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .
0	user interface : the software is simple and straight forward .
0	creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .
1	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) .
0	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate & # 38 ; . very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
0	i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .
1	then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .
1	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . .
0	i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .
0	great quality picture and features .
1	durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
0	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .
1	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
1	the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .
0	other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans .
0	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
0	overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .
0	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
0	great features . . .
0	we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
1	p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .
1	even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with `` mac settings `` , etc .
0	but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .
1	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
0	the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $ 25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )
1	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
1	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
0	itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .
0	i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .
0	if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .
0	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
0	if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $ 15 dollars i think ) .
0	i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .
0	however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .
1	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
0	big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 `` is enough
1	once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .
0	the fm radio is cool .
0	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) .
1	not a killer problem , but not well done , either .
0	in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .
1	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .
0	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! .
0	i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned ! .
0	the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .
0	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
1	a bit disappoint on that ! .
0	i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
1	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
0	don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .
1	i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .
0	the storage capacity is great for me --
1	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
0	their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .
0	it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .
0	it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot .
0	the software is great .
0	the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .
1	even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up .
0	one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .
0	1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .
1	battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .
0	i got it working fast enough .
1	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
1	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
0	this phone has many other features , ir , ; . just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
0	so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html
0	cuts are easy and smooth .
0	this product is a lifesaver ! . ! .
0	it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .
1	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
0	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
0	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
1	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
0	fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $ 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .
0	it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .
0	20 gb or 40 gb ? . the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a `` dock station `` and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ) .
0	this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .
1	however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .
0	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
1	i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel .
1	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
0	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
0	battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .
0	- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .
0	what an upgrade ! . ! . ! .
0	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
0	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
1	i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up .
0	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .
0	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
1	of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless .
1	i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .
0	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
1	there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .
0	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .
0	the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .
0	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
1	it seems like the software is just not responding .
0	before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .
0	so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .
1	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
0	it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .
0	if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .
0	the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .
1	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
0	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
1	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
0	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
0	good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .
1	yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .
0	i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .
1	just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .
0	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
0	all in all , this is a great phone .
0	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
0	and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
0	get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .
0	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
0	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful `` scene `` mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .
1	the volume .
0	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
0	the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .
0	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
0	i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .
1	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
0	flawless .
0	and the video quality is amazing .
1	but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .
0	the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .
0	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
1	1 ) it is perhaps too small .
1	also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .
1	i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .
0	although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .
0	pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .
0	so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .
0	i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .
0	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
0	also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .
0	as said before this works perfectly .
1	the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
0	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .
1	even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .
1	the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .
0	having usb 2 . 0 makes for very fast transfers .
1	respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .
1	too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .
0	bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .
0	works pretty well .
1	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
0	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
0	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
1	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
0	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
0	when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .
1	and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .
0	this phone is a winner . . .
0	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
0	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
1	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
0	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
0	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
1	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today .
1	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
0	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly .
0	this is a great camera for you ! .
0	it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .
1	opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .
0	the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .
0	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
1	on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .
0	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
0	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
0	all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .
0	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
0	this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .
1	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
0	the new canon s300 is 33 % larger and 26 % heavier than the s100 .
1	speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .
0	extremely convenient .
0	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
1	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
0	the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .
0	the bottom line is `` phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones `` .
0	works great ! . ! . ! . ! .
1	right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .
0	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
0	i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .
0	the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .
0	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
1	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
1	it still smelled .
0	this camera is truely superb .
0	when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .
0	this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .
0	and it holds so much music and audio files .
1	i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .
1	) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? .
0	it doesn 't bog down under load .
1	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
1	the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .
0	it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access .
0	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
0	it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .
0	glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .
0	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
0	i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .
0	its also smaller , and gets more looks .
0	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
1	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
0	you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
1	it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves .
0	not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $ 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .
1	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
1	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :
0	i am quite happy with the camera .
0	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
0	everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .
0	the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .
0	other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .
0	i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .
0	i am very pleased so far .
0	i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far .
0	the zen offered a great alternative .
1	the interface took a little getting used to .
1	other than that it is all the same except the new updates .
1	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
0	as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .
0	the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .
0	if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .
1	i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .
0	the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .
0	the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .
0	i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .
0	it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .
1	now this router is not the cheapest on the market .
0	while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .
1	the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
0	i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .
0	i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .
0	i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .
1	the only complaint i have is that the 1/4 `` collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 `` bits .
0	there is no odor and it is very easy to use .
1	looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .
1	the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .
0	this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .
0	i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .
1	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
0	the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .
0	the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .
1	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
1	the flaw is inside the zen .
0	this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .
0	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
1	the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
1	4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the `` other than phone `` functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .
0	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod 's dirty secret . com .
0	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
